This library is simple, since it only has one function called
''my_function()''.

Numbers
=======
''my function(()'' returns the product of its arguments. For nunmbers, that value is equvalent to using the ''*'' operator.


::

	>>> from doctest_in_help import my_function
	>>> my_function(2, 3)
	6

It also works with floating-point values.

::

	>>> my_function(2.0, 3)
	6.0

Non-Numbers
===========

Because ''*'' is also defined on data types  other than numbers, 
''my_function()'' works just a s well if one of the argunments is a string, a list, or a tuple.

::

	>>> my_function('a', 3)
	'aaa'

	>>> my_function(['A', 'B', 'C'], 2)
	['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C']
