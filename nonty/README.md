/*Stack-Based Interpreter in C*/

This is a simple stack-based interpreter written in C. It reads a file containing stack manipulation instructions and executes them. It is designed to handle basic stack operations, such as pushing elements onto the stack and printing the stack's contents.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before using this program, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC.
Compilation

To compile the program, you can use the following command:

bash

gcc -o stack-interpreter stack-interpreter.c

Usage

Run the program by providing the input file as a command-line argument:

bash

./stack-interpreter input_file

    input_file should be a text file containing a list of stack manipulation instructions. Each line of the file should follow the format: <instruction> <argument>.

Example Input File:

perl

push 5
push 10
pall
push 20
pall

This input file will push numbers onto the stack, print the stack's contents at different points, and allow you to observe the stack's behavior.
Output

The program will execute the instructions and print the stack's contents when the "pall" instruction is encountered. It will also provide error messages for invalid instructions or any other issues.
Contributing
